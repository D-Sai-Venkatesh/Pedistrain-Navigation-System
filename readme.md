Pedestrian navigation systems (PNS) are used in a range of applications, from pure navigation and
guidance tools, healthcare assistance systems and more generally location based services. The main
goal of a PNS is to have an accurate and reliable position estimate. This can be achieved by many
methods, we will look into some of them in later sections. Generally for navigation system GPS based
systems are used, but in indoor environments GPS signals are very weak. So using GPS indoors will
result less accurate position estimations. To overcome this IMU data is being used to estimate position
indoors.
